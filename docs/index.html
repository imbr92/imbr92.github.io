<h1>Home</h1>
<p>
    Hello, welcome to my website! I have wanted to set up my own website for quite some time, but have put it off until now. As of now, I plan on using this page to host some blogs, learn some HTML/CSS and consolidate links to my profiles on various other platforms.
</p>


<p>
    Website Design: I will try to keep this site minimal by doing my best to limit its reliance on fancy Javascript and unnecessary styling. For now, I'm not sure if I can do without it entirely, at least without MathJax. If you have any suggestions, feel free to contact me in one of the ways at the bottom of this page.
</p>
